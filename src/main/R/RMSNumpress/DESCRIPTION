Description: Rcpp bindings to the native C++ implementation of MS Numpress, that provides two compression schemes for numeric data from mass spectrometers. The library provides implementations of 3 different algorithms, 1 designed to compress first order smooth data like retention time or M/Z arrays, and 2 for compressing non smooth data with lower requirements on precision like ion count arrays..
